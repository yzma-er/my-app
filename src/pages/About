      This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help students and staff 
        navigate different school processes and services at NVSU.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", textAlign: "justify", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        The system provides clear, step-by-step instructions for tasks such as ID 
        processing and accessing school facilities like the Gymnasium, DFTC, 
        Mini-Theater, Padilla Hall, Guest House, Staff House, and the university 
        dormitories.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", textAlign: "justify", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        It also includes infographic videos for each step, a feedback rating 
        feature, and downloadable request forms to guide users easily and clearly.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", textAlign: "justify", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        The system currently offers predefined steps, does not support payment 
        transactions, and is available only at the NVSU Main Campus.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", textAlign: "justify", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        Our goal is to make school processes easier, clearer, and more convenient 
        for everyone.
